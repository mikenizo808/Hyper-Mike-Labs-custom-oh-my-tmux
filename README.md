# Hyper-Mike-Labs-custom-oh-my-tmux
My custom tmux configuration including people in space (requires PowerShell 7 or better). Adjust to point to the desired city for weather (currently Chicago). 

This setup runs great on `Ubuntu 24.04` which is my native setup. For more tips on setting up your terminal or getting started with `tmux` see the included guides in this repository. They are a sneek peek at my upcoming full guide showing how to setup your laptop for develeopment on Linux (specifically `Ubuntu 24.04`, but use your favorite!).
